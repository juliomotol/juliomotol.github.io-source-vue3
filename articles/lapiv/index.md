Lapiv is a small package that makes it much easier and cleaner to create versioned APIs for your Laravel Application. It provides multiple methods of API Versioning such as via URI, query string parameters and HTTP headers which all are very extensible and can be configured to the developer's liking.

To learn more about the project, read the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@julio.motol89/laravel-api-versioning-the-why-and-how-6c2b883e8234) that I wrote.
