This - what you're seeing right now - is my personal portfolio website. Here you'll find things about me, my projects, and ways to get in touch.

I built this site as a new year's resolution for 2020 with the goal of reinveting myself" and has been fully decked out with a new personal logo, trendy features(dark mode), and elaborately displays things about me.

On the technical side, this is built with Vue.js (scaffolded with vue-cli) and its family of libraries (Vuex and Vue Router). For theming, I used Bulma as I found it interesting at the time due to its modularization and easy customization.
