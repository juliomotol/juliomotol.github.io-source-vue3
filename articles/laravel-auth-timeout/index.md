Laravel Auth Timeout is a small middleware package that handles authentication timeouts by checking if the user had made any request in a set of time. If they have reached the idle time limit, they are then logged out on their next request. Huge thanks to Brian Matovu's [article](http://bmatovu.com/laravel-session-timeout-auto-logout/).

To learn more about the project, read the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@julio.motol89/laravel-how-to-log-out-a-user-after-a-time-of-inactivity-99594dd73459) that I wrote.
